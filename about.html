        <p> Welcome to LuxEssence, a skincare website made to help people understand their skin and choose the right products. Our name comes from the words “luxury” and “essence,” which means that we believe taking care of your skin is not only a need but also a special part of self-care.

            We made this website to guide people, especially beginners, who are confused about what skincare products to use. Everyone has different skin types and problems like dryness, oiliness, acne, or sensitivity. So we want to make it easier to find what works best for you.
            
            We also created a simple quiz to help you know your skin type. After taking the quiz, we suggest products that match your answers. We believe that when you know your skin better, you can take better care of it.
            
            At LuxEssence, we believe that skincare is not just about beauty, it is about health, confidence, and loving yourself. Whether you are just starting your skincare journey or want to learn more, we are here to help you.
            
            Thank you for visiting LuxEssence. We hope we can help you find the glow you deserve! </p>
